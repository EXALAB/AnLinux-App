    <string name="first_warning_content">First of all, thanks for downloading AnLinux, below are some important parts, please read carefully.\n\n1. To keep the distro small and light weight for easy install, most distro except Arch Linux and Kali Nethunter are minimal rootfs, which means most package are not installed yet, you could install them according to your need, and stop asking if the distro is faked.\n\n2. All distro are installed in this directory: /data/data/com.termux/files/home , please make sure that you have enough space before installing package and don\'t blame the app for occupying your device space because you are the one controlling it.\n\n3. Some distro may not available due to your device architecture.\n\n4. Currently, all device except mips based will work, if you encountered any error such as Proot signal 6, or function not implemented, just go to the Patches feature in app and apply SECCOMP patch.\n\n5. Seems like the maintainer of Parrot Security OS decided to drop support for all arm device, so there will be no arm image anymore in the future until they decided to support it again, please use Kali or BlackArch as an alternative option.\n\n6. NEVER install two Desktop Environment or Desktop Environment alongside Window Manager on a same distro, if you want to install another Desktop Environment or Window Manager, please reinstall the distro first. To do this, use "Uninstall" feature first, then reinstall it from Dashboard.\n\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day :)</string>

    <string name="arch_linux_warning_content">Arch Linux image is bigger than other distro (Around 400 MB), and may cost a lot of device space after decompressing. Having spare space over 1.5GB is highly recommended before installing.\n\n\nNote:\n\n1. Tar may produce an error while extracting the image such as: tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword \'SCHILY.fflags\', it is not harmful, simply ignore it.\n\n2.
